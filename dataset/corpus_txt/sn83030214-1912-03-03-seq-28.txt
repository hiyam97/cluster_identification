JETSAM pulled up, looking cared. "Gee!" he said to
Flotsam. Thi no fools. They caught on

"Don't need no crew!" Flotsam said, pretty faint.
For a week thev had watched the experiments with

her little ai'ri.d wires caught up the wirekss wavi
out from the Government pl.iiit up on the bluff, and
snatched them down below to the electrical dynamos,
which worked the operating machinery, to starl or stop
the motor, and swing the tiller right or left.
It was all perfectly -imple and the new ho.it didn't
need any men aboanl l" handle her! That was the ?a? t
that stuck ont hke a ?ire thumb for poor Flotsam and
Jetsam. They were life savers; therefore they kicked
on innovation-, and, 1>. ?idi s, now their own future was
in danger. No mure surflioat! No more bunching
from the flat wheeled s.uid wagon! No more midnight
?lashes in the big white in.,tor, with the tar barrels
blazing on the beach, ami fifty men at the breeches buov
stretchers yanking up the long cable clear of the surf,
ami hauling in shipwrecked nun, with Seas roaring!

It made th.- outlook bkick for the crea of the old
fashioned lifeboats if the wireless boal could pick her
own way through the reef channels, dodge Gridiron
