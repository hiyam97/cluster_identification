Upon my word, I had to feel s?.nv foi
Victor! To be ?ure, he \\. s hardly an idea

moreover, by motives purely mereenary
but he was human, ?usl the same, and u
that moment he undoubtedly suffered
Suffered! It was torments thai he under?

And, like his body, his head seemed galvan

jerked away like .1 tooth; then, as though
by some irresistible law of nature, like tin
un el or the tide., Ii.uk went his eyes t?
her lia? k every time.
This little drama, which lasted ?perhaps
ten minutes, ?cerned by its very intensity
prolonged to as mam hours. Then sud?
denly 1 beheld the tortured le^s of Victor,
whi? h quivered and then ?remained trans?
fixed, like those "I a -.mitten beast. Invol?
untarily I turned and looked. Tin-rein the
brilliant eve. under the little dark hat, benl
i ever upon \" i ? tor, had gathered two shin?
ing tears. Whether by art or by genuine
emotion, the effect was perfect. Thus soft?
ened l?v sorrow, the eyes ?became of magi?
cal enchantment, of irresistible seduction.
"( "ome!" thev said. "M v beloved one, come!"
Suddenly Vi? tor leaped to his feet. "I'm
damned," I heard him say under his breath,
"if I can staiiil this any more!"
IJIS . hair, ktim ked away by his hasty ges?
ture, fell crushed to the ground. From
flirting, from bragging, or from laying down
the law, the attention of all was ?suddenly
n 11 aimed to him, as. stepping forward for a
?half-dozen pa? e i, he seized Pay by the hand.
"Come, Pay!" he ?-aid in a voice

"Mother, I'm going! ?G-oodby!"
Had he suddenly gone mad and drawn a
pistol, the commotion could hardly have
iiei'ii greater. The whole company leaped
to its feet, in a (latter of overturned chairs
and smashing wineglasses.
Ermentrude, like the goose she is, ?began t?>
scream, "< Ih! Is it a tire.-'"
Mi-. Cobb, pal?- and immovable m her
place, callc'l her son's name. "Victor!
Come here'"
Victor turned: but, sustained by the
adoring beams of those eyes that hail van?
quished him, he found for th.- find time in
liis life Strength to defy even those stcelv
orbs which from infancy had commanded
hi; oliedieiue. For tin' first time since I had
known him I am bound to own that he ap
?geared admirable and that I ?admired him.
Force had come into his slouching shoulders,
lire into his eyes. He held up his ?head and
answered his mother like a man:

Mrs. Cobb spoke first in a ? hoked voice.
"Youdesert me, your mother? You

Her son's voice ?eemed the echo of hen

I'm a man. and by Heaven I'll take a man'

For answer she clung t.. his arm. Y.

I wanted to i lap mj hands in pure admira

still holding Fay by the hand, he walkei
resolutely away toward the elevator. Hi
mother, as though turned to stone, stooi
gazing after him with anguished eyes.
?TPON my word!" I heard a voice muttei
^ somewhere near me, "One has t.
admire the fellow. after all!"
"Righl you ar?'!" I wanted to cry out ii
response. Hut a sudden thought came n
me and took my breath. Since of his <>wi
free will Victor had abandoned me, I wai
tree free to ^<> to Henry!
Ah, Henry, my dear, dear Henry! Th<
thought of him in that instant was t.... mucl
for me, and I began to cry.
Instantly and from all quarters there wai
a rush of consolation toward me. From tlu
deserting bridegroom, attention wasal on?
recalled t<? focus itself upon the deserted
bride.
"Ah. poor little thing!" "Dear Made?
moiselle, trj to control yourself!" "Pool
little creature, what a traged) for her!"
While somewhere in the immediate back?
ground I heard Aunt Elizabeth's v< -h e boom?

Hut through the compassion of her words
struck a note of secret pleasure that I under?

position-, according to all human probabil?
ity, been precisely reversed? And Portia
was pitying me, triumphing ..ver me! The
idea was too ridiculous, and I burst out
laughing. Then, somehow, the laughter gol
tangled up with the tears, and when I tried
to stop laughing I found thai I couldn't.
Hut the absurd part of it was, all the time I
was laughing for sheer happiness Henry,
