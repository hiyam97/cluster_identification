enough and wicked enough, perhai
had prevented the t?eamer from taking c

mighl he in time to keep Henry froi
. after all!
Downstairs in the hall there were crrui
delays, incredible delays, ?before the mai
little 1 * in ( loak. I
have gone al once without it; bul in m
white hue dinner dn , with its hangin
ms of pearls, I noticed that pcopl
gh I had 1 >< aped fro?
the Jardin des Plantes. Besides, it v.
nearly one o'clock, and I didn't want t
make poor Henry ridiculous, arriving t
look for him if he was sti'l then- loolcin
like a wild creature.
Bui al la ' the cloak wa ? found am
wrapped around me. Then inore d<
maddening delays for a taxi. Then final];
ah, that wild ?dash through the sultr;
streets of the city, Ik hind a chauffeur tryin;
to cam a ten-dollar tip by arriving at tin
do? k of the Frem h Line in ten minute
with a volcan?, in my heart!
As we turned in al the entram <? of the lonj
wharf shed, suddenly I heard the hoars?
blast of a steamer'.-, whistle. Ali, I km w

The fellow replied with a , "No
curse her, she ain't !"
Oh, dear, kind triker, ted by Heaven, 1
owed this good fortune to you: < opening m>
bag again, I to i I the man a bill, just to re?
lieve the joy of my heart. ?Behind me I
heard the horn of anoth? r late comer's auto?
mobile. Por a momenl I he itati d, Tin
warehouse was so long, then were
lights, so many people! Win re should 1 K'1

precipitated myself in the ?dir? tion whence
tiie whistle had ionic. Suddenly 1 heard a

"Lili, Lili!"
I turned. It was Mrs. ?Cobb!
-TMIL sight of her, which had nevi r pleased

o unwelcome to me as at thai instant.
Bui tor mere decency 1 had to check my
flying steps and wail lor her to cat? h up with
me. II. i ? ild, her han- shoulder?

out my hand violently:

She seized my hand in both of ?hers. And
together we sped down the dim, intermina?
ble (?engtfa of the wharf shed; while Mrs.
?Cobb, gasping for breath, let fall questions
and answers that were no more than half
intelligible.
"I.ili, my poor child! You I ra/.y . hil,], to
