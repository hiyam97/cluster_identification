him in one?thousand?dollar bills to avoid an;

decided on ?before the necessity for quid
action anise, The Dauntless was nearl

She mea tun d one hun Ired and twenty-tivi
feel over all, ami had a powerful wheel tha
could drive her along at thirteen knots at
hour, which was iasi tmough for all our ordi
narv ni?.?.! -
The Dauntless was immctliately turne?
over to Mr. Huau, the Delegate al Jackson
ville of the provisional ?Government of Cuba
and his assistant, Alphonso W. Pritot, as sh<
was tu lie despatched from their territory.
A S a matter of fact, they sacrificed mon
for the Cuban cause and ?rendered il
mon etli. ?eut service than ?li?l the delegatior
in S'ew Vork, though they were not s?> rnucl
in the limelight. Huau was never called or
for money thai he did n??t respond, and his
liniiii- was always open t<> sick or otherwisi
unfortunate < 'ulians.
Pritot, who was his nephew, was east in
the same mold. He was born in Cuba of
French-American ?parentage. His lather,
win? had ?been master mechanic of the Sa
vanilla Railroad al Matanzas, was driven
into exile ?after ?having been twice imprisoned
for his revolutionary tendencies. He died
from the ?effects <>t his confinement, and the
son grew up with a ?bitter ?hatred of every?
thing Spanish.
Pntol was the aetive worker at Jackson?
ville, and in the ways that were ??pen to him
he was the most useful member <>t the entire
revolution?r)' organization ?ashore. He was
at that time joint agent for all the railroads
running into Jacksonville, and his position
made n ?possible for him to ?1?? things of tt<
m?endoUS value whieh m> one else (Xiuld have
done. He had the advantage, too, of living
in a ?hotbed of Cuban sympathizers.- It was
not sate to ipeak .1 kin?i word for ?Spain any?
where in Florida.
The detectives who were assigned to watt h
him had many troubla. When he saw a
it ranger whom he suspected of being a spy
hanging round the depot, he would have the
special offi lion arrest him on
charge of vagrancv?or <>n general prini
pies, it made no different e whi< h. The pr
oner ? ully searched at the polii e si
tion, and his room ?-as also ransacked,
anything was found to indicate that ',
ini^lit !>< -. he was . on*,

sent to iln- ?'.,? kpile or tli<* turpentine far

supposed that "all is fair in love and war"
and ii th. ' went beyoni

truthfully claimed that they were nearly s
lawless, so ti murderous a
the Spaniards.
[AMES FLOYD, a Jacksonville pilot wh
J had a ma ?ter's li. en e, was plai ?'.1 in com
inaii.l ..i the Dauntless, and in a dav .>r twi
she left Brunswick and proceeded leisurel;
down the coast to the mouth of the Satill;
River, sixty miles north of Jacksonville, on
tensibly in search of a wreck. Under he
coastwise licen* she could u" anywher
without regard to the custom house regula
ti..n> governing ships bound for I
parts. Floyd was a negro; I ?tit in every
tiling except hi- >km he was white, as well a
clever and shrewd.
As s....n .i-. Rubens telegraphed us that th.
Dauntless had been purchased, things begai
tu move rapidly. Two-thirds of the arm
were ordered t.> New York al once; th<
other third, which filled two cars, wai
shipped to Jacksonville by express, Th?.
Laurada, which was reported to be going ti
Jamaica for fruit, left Philadelphia with in?
structions t.? proceed t<> Barnegat Light,
forty miles south -.t' New York, and await
orders. The arms she was t.> carry wen
brought down on the Bridgeport boat and
allowed to remain in the vessel when the rest
of her cargo was unloaded.
Late in the at'tern. m m. followed as usual 1>V
two detectives, I went t.. New York and
drifted aimlessly about for two ..r three
hours. S....n after dark I was lounging
around City Hall Park, when a carriage,
which I had ordered t.. meet meat that par?
ticular spot at that precise moment, in
which were Dr. Castillo and General Carloa
Roloff, Secretar) of War in the revolutionary
Government, drove up. I jumped in, and
we were driven away before the sleuths had
time to think. There was no other disen?
gaged carriage in sight, and before they
could find one we were oui ol si^ht.
We wit driven, at a lively gait and by I
roundabout route, to the Bridgeport Line
wharf, and the big swinging doors were
closed an.l locked as soon as we were inside.
There had been n.> attempt at secrecy in
shipping the arms from Bridgeport; bul the
detectives who had been assigned to keep a
sharp eye <-n them had k,,1u' o? watch, tak?
ing it for granted that they would not be
moved at night.
After they had departed and just before
we arri\",| an apparently empty lighter was
towed into the slip and tied up 00 the oppo?
site side ut' the pier from the steamship with
the arms. When the gates had been closed,
so in. one oil the OUtside COttld see what was
going on, we began hustling our cargo out of
the steamer and across the pier into the
lighter, with the aid of a lane party of
Cubans who had been txmcealed on the lat?
ter craft. At midnight, by which time all
