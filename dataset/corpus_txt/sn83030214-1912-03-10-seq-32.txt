Rubens exploded this theory by producing the Revised
Statut?*?, which, much to the surprise ol the (Jovern
lawyers, gave the United States jun-h. tion ??vt-r
Navassa Island. Then the ?Goveroment determined to
indicl me, and, as I chose to remain in Jacksonville,
where the climate at that particular time was most
congenial, the |amaica ncgr?.< - w< re taken ?lure t?. tes?

lynchers to abandon their plan: bul not until ft
had argued with them more earnestly than he ever had
;,, plead with a jury to -ecure an acquittal.
fh( negro? ? identified me easily enough and told all
they ?knew; but the jury unanimously refu ed to vote
an indictment. Negro testimony didn't cunt f?,r
much in Jacksonville, and anti-Cuban testimony, ri<)
matter what the color of the witnesses, di?ln't count
for anything at all. After his dismissal in New York,
Nunez was taken to Jacksonville ?and ?tried spun for
filibustering, this time with referen? to the I)
and again acquitted. This left the Government with
no legal grounds for holding the Dauntless, and the was
released.
