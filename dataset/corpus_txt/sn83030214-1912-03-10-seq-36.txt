A CAPTAIN UNAFRAID
C'outbtstd from pag*. 10
were shipped on a Clyde liner from Ni
Vork '" Jacksonville, where they were trai
ferred to two expresa cars without any ;
tempt ai ?-xmcealment.
A day or two More they arrived the
General Miguel Betancouri (a veteran of tl
Ten V'ears' War who was to comman?i tl
landing party), General Preyre Andra?
(afterwanl a m>?mber of ?Presidenl Palma
Cabinel an?! more r<-< ?ntK- Speaker of tl
House in the Cuban ?Congress, of whi<
la- was one of the dominani figures), wl
was t" .u company him, General \'uftez, I)
t '. tillo, Cartaya, and I started ?outh froi
Mew York. We were trailed by a dozen .1'
let tives, and tor their lienefil we ht I
t?. ?Savannah, a*- though trying t?. dodg
them, ami then to Charleston, where we n
peated the bluff "t' using the Commodon
which was still lying in 'li*' harbor und?
guard "t" a revenue cutter.
While tin- ileuths had their eyes on tli
?Commodore, which was getting -tram u
and sending black smoke streaming "tit ?
her stack in a way thai would have bee
criminally careless under other condition
we ?lipped away toja? ksonville, where Frit?
had mail., arrangements for us to continu
our journey in style. The private car ?
J. R. Parrott, vice prcsidenl and genera
manager of the Florida ?Sa I Coasl Railwa)
had been pla? ed at our disposal, with an en
eine, and the special train was waiting t'<>r ua
Sir. Parrotl was unable '?? accompany ti>
bul lu- ? m In ? genera] superintendent, R. '1'
Goff, t?. make it appear that a few of hi:
friends wire <_;<?in?_; down the line on an in
tion trip.
Fredericks r???1?? with us; but it was ti"i
long until several members of tin- part-.
wished it hail been ?possible for him t" maki
the trip by some other route. II? ? arried a
shabby old valise, t" which none of us had
previoti ly paid any attention; liutil ecmed
-?i mu? h ?mi "t pla? ?? in the handsomely ap?
pointed pnv.it?. car that everyone took a
.I nature?! kick at it. Frederi? k - laughed
-?, loudly as li?' saw it being knocked around
thai -"in,?,n? finally askcl him whai it cc?n?
taincd.
"Nothing l>ut fulminate of men ury deto?
nator ." h?- replied.
"Wh.it are they t<?r.-"""
"To sel ?.(T the shells from the big gun."
"Are they m??re explosive than dynai
"< ?nly ten or I wenty times a- mm h so."
This startling information put the laugh
on us, ninth t" the enjoymeni of the dia
iKtlical Fredericks, and the tirst man who
regain???! the use of hi- legs tenderly de?
! tin re\*erently respected gripsack in
a stateroom and locked the door. That was
one of the times when Providen? ?? was kind to
ti-. It seemed a miracle that fulmin
nur? iir\ ??.ubi be subjected to such brutali
with..ut exploding, and there was enough
it in the valise to have blown all ofustowi
The fa? ' that we ran as a special, an?! th
the train as it left Jacksonville con^tsted on
of the engine and Parrott's car, prevent
any inquisitive persons from surreptitiews
accompanying us, and then was no train i
which they could follow n** until the tie
day. A short distance below the city \
picked up the two i arloads of arms and ar
munition, which had been run down ar
pta< el on an ob? ure sidetrack, and at Ne
Smyrna we added two day coaches contaii
ing seventy-five Cubans, who had ben
brought over from Tan.pa on a special trail
A' Palm Eteach, which was .les?'rte?l at th;
titile ut" year, the train was run ??tit ontl
Florida East Coast pier ?alongside t!
Dauntless, which was waiting for us. I
was an easy matter to ?gel the cargo aboai
her. and sne was steaming toward Cuba i
a few hours.
"hkJL'N'EZ and I were barred from aecon
panyinc her by a ruse of the Spanis
Minister at Washington, who, having I?
?nine suspicious that another expeditio
under.way, had the filibustering chare
against us, growing oui "? our trip with th
Bermuda, moved up on th?- docket and -?
for trial within a few day-. Consequent h
Dr. Castillo took charge of the expedition
and Captain W. II. I.? wi-, of the Tim
Friends, went in i ommand of the Dauntl?
Tlie expedition wa - landed on the night ?.
?i. toller 2?'? at the mouth of the San Juai
River, fifteen miles east of Cienfucgos. A
it was being unloaded a little Spanish gun
boat went by, close inshore; but she fail.-,
t., notice the Dauntless. General Betan
? nur? was so slow in getting 'he arm- ba? 1
into the bush that a larev pari of them wen
lost. Th.y wen- left lying around the bead
for four days, with the natural result thai
tiny wen- discovered by a passing warshi]
and ? aptured. The dynamite ?gun was saved
largely through the energy "f the untamed
Pretlericks; but half of the rifles and ear
tridges tell into the hands of the enemy.
General Gomez was so enraged by this un
ntx'cssary loss of arms, which were badh
needed, thai he threatened to have General
Betancourt shot, and probably would have
don- o hut for his >?>?...! record in the pr<
vious revolution. Betancourl subsequently
committed suicide, and it wa- believed that
hi- self destruction was due. in sf-mc degree,
to w..rrv and remorse over this incident.
