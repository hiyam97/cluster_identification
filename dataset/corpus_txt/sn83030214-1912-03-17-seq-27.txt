land by means of the whistle
that there was no ' ause for alarm,
and they warily returned; but we
had los* -.ver..! hours, and it was
dark before we got the last of the
aboard.
We pas, d Key West at sunrise,
eight miles out. They must have
? : ? gnized us from the
naval station; but they knew they
could not catch us and did not
(.?re to try. We ran on round Caps
San Antonio, at the west end of
Cuba, and on the morning of Jan?
uar.- .S pul the cargo and party
ashore in Corrientes Bay, just in?
side of Cape Corrientes.
This final performance was more
lik?- a Fourth of July celebration
than the secretive landing of a
filibustering expedition. Aswecame
t?. an anchor I intended t?i give one
sh'.rt blast "f the whistle, to sum?
mon some of Maceos troops, who
vv-re waiting for us near the cape;
hut something went wrong with the
siren and it boomed its loudest for
a full five minutes, before we could
shut it off. The Dauntless had a
siren that would have done credit
to an ocean liner, and if there
were any Spanish troops or a gun
? within ten miles of us they
ought t(? have heard it. Our
nerves had hardly recovered from
this shock before a careless Cuban dropped a t?ox
of dynamite on a ?oral ret?, and it exploded with a
roar that started the echoes to going again. Fortu?
nately, the man with the slippery lingers was far
enough away from thi ?? f the party so that no one
else was killed.
The only man who was not annoyed by all this un
seemly racket was Michael Walsh. He hailed th?' dis
turbance with hearty approval, as a possible promise
of trouble.
"I.-1 'em '? ?!. when it was saget ted
tliat the Spaniards might Ik* down on us at any minute.
"1 came down here looking for scraps, and the more of
