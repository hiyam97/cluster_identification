You have seen dynamite explosions before, 1

"One, Sir."
"In your opinion was this present one caused by
large or a small charge?"
"Rather small."
"Large enough to blow a man into indiscernible fra

"Exactly. Keep the stand, please. Mr. Swart I

Pi ? or Kent, will you kindl) tell th? jury of the con?
dition in which you ?found Miss Wayland's desk?"
"Tin- desk stands in Miss Wayland's library," ex?
plained Kent. "Half an hour after the explo ion, when
Miss Wavland sat at iT. it was intai t. Sometime within
the next hour and a half the drawer in which she kept
certain belongings locked was entered. This drawer is
a large. Hat one. above the open part of the desk beneath
which the knees of ?.ne writing pass. The bottom was
hastily and roughly eut. and n OSt o? the i ontents of the
drawer were removed. Lette:- and papers we;.- found
just outside one of the windows of the room. There
was no money in the drawer, according to the owners
best recollection. Hut certain papers and accounts arc
now missing; also a box < ont.lining headache powdi ."
"Thank you," said the Coroner, "Now, gentlemen
of tlie jury, you will note the pet uliarity of the p w '.
living kept, while seme of the papers were abandoned.
This may have been a.. ?dent; it may have been design.
If the latter, I ?all your notice to the possibility of such
powder- being retained for suicidal use, in case of dis
? o\ ery."
Had the jury and the witness ''ti the stand 1 een less
absorbed by the new turn of interest thus abruptly
given, they might have perceived a telegraphic glance
from the ( oroner to Kent, followed by a nod of appro.
ing s,,ti faction from the professor. The smile broad
ened almo t into a grin when a juryman, tising. asked;
"Were these powders poisonous?"
"That is a matter tliat we will inquire into," replied
the Coroner promptly. "Mr. Swart, you have been a
physician.'"
"Yes, Sir. To a limite^! extent. I still am. TI: e
powdi y prest ribing."
"I hd they i ontain a poi i?n:"
"Wir . ye . in a ? n ic. They contained a very potent
drug. a. ctanilid."
"That is a coaltar product, which relieve certain
forms of headache by a depressing influent e on tin heart
a< tion, thus decreasing the flow of blood t<? the head?"
"Yes. I M. Shurtleff.
"I'lta ?? tell the jury whether it is ?langerons t?? life."
"Not in the ordinary dosage that these powders con?
tained, two .,11'! a halt grains eai h."
"How much would be a certainly fatal dose?"
