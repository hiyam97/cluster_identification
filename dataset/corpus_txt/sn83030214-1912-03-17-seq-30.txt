"Saint ?if me SOwl!" half whispered Dennis. "It look

"And this handwriting?" He laid up the "Blacl

"I dun'no. I dun'no. How could it be? An' yet i

"Hut surely the man never planted that note afte

A sharp rapping on the ( 'oroner's table focused atten?

"Come to order, Gentlemen," said he sharply. "This
court is still in ses ion. We now know that the alleged
b<nl'. upon which we are holding iti?|ti?'st is not that of
Dennis Movie; but there is no proof that it is not that of
some other person, unknown. Hen? e I still hold jurisdic?

be material in the so called oak room <>n the third floor
pertinent to this inquiry. The jury will follow me there."
HPIIK whole procession filed upstairs. Dennis Boyle
jealously accompanied by the In pector of police.
Entering the room, the Coroner found a ?hair mar the
head ?if the bed. while Kent leaned against the Wall b.nk
of him. ? >n the bed lay a hatchet.

perjury in the Wapiti lands investigation, has recently
??ecu in finaro ial straits. To get out he has falsified the
accounts of the Montfort Quarries and forged Miss
Wayland's name."
"A lie!" i rooked the ai i used nan.
"Truth, impli and provable. There, then, is motive.
At the next quarterly meeting of the quarries company
Swart was sure to lie exposed, miles, he could get rid of
his aunt n eantime. Now for the opportunity. Swart ?sa
prai tical quarryman ami understands dynamite, in
cluding one oi it peculiar properties in repose, which
only experts know about, lie is a physician and under?
stand- drug-. Remember and i onnei t these two points.
He ha, the run of this old house ami is thoroughly fa?
miliar with it. Two months ago he began to work on
his plan; iiist aboul the time, you will note, that Miss
Way land, who had hardly known a sick day in her life,
?lev? loped those singular headaches. II?' began by get?

a stick <.i dynamite, wrapped in the thickly greased
paper in whii h some dynamite ? ornes, hack of the worm
holed pan? ling at the head of each of Mi,s Wayland's
two beds, one in ero h room."
"Mut you've already said." objected the old lady,
"that Robert never attempted to dynamite anyone."
"You have all heard Dr. Swart testify on the starot
to the effects of acetanilid," pursued Kent, apparently
disregarding the interruption. "That was in response
to Coroner Shurtleff's suggestion of a suicidal motive
on the pari of the unknown rifler of th<- <!? -!;. I may
now stat? that tin- theory was a purely at tificial one
the attack "il the desk will be made i tear in goo?! tin i
designed to lead on the witness without arousing his
suspicions. He responded admirably t<? the point, stat
ing that acetanilid in two and a half grain doses would
serve to ? me headai he. and that in a twenty live grain
dos?- it would be fatal. Will, he was preparing to have
Miss Wayland take a twenty-five-grain dos? m such a
way that no suspicion would fall upon himself."
"How.'-" demanded the old lady with an air of lively
hut impersonal interest.
"By getting vou into the habit of taking -mall r?gulai
doses, an'! then loading one of the DO?
ders with a deadly dose. You will ol>?
erve that when a person who has Keen
accustomed to take a drug regularly,
?lies of an overdosi of that drug, 'In

"Bui I was liking the powders for

her brow in pu//!? ment.

At this. Swart recovered himself from the -hiverin?

"The box of powders itself, and the and. ?i of the

Miss VVayland eagerly.
