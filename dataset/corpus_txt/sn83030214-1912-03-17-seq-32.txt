Hu'. aciordine to the playwright, I had put on only th?
finishing touches.
If a playwright ?en on "f mine, the first thing I
should do to help him along would le to plate him
my knee and apply the dipper. I am sure he
would stand a double chance of .access after that.
And the older dramatists, who will not work with a
ii .mager, ate Mist as bad.
Everything connected in anyway with th?' theater
demands the dramatic instinct even bill posting!
That is no joke. I am perfe? tly serious. Mv office boy,
Johnny, has got the dramati. in-tin? t. If he didn't
have it, I shouldn't have him around. But ?he funny
and sad part of the game is that thon on the outside
believe that dramati? instill, t is the last thing in th?
World that i- essential in a theatrical manager. Mo ?
people believ? that all one needs to be a manager and
producer is g.1 health and big hmg>. The richest,
healthiest, strongest, bist educated, most polished man
?.n the face of thi- earth would be a flat failure in the
producing business if he did not have the instinct. I
have even known scene painters who were failure ; i
eau e they lacked this quality. You ask tre what this
instimt is? Well, neither 1 nor anyone else can explain.
. thing born with one, like red hair or a g<*>d
digestion. If a producer did not have the dramatic
instinct, In' would go broke in a week. Never a ?lay
passes that orne individual does not approach a man?
ager with a plan to write a play based on some inci?
dent in In- own life. There is probably not a -oui
alive who doesn't honestly believe that an episode in
his life would not make just the best play ever pro?
duced .md these persons .done would bankrupt a
manager if he listened to them seriously. And they
are the tiniest, mo I insignificant hue in the business
at that, u the manager is concerned.
NI i\V w.m? to tlie one-night-stand man.,-, r and
wIhii we are discu >ing trials let your eye rest
long on tin individual. He is not only a trial: he is a
whole cotirthou >?. In addition to being manager of the
playhouse in the ?linky little town, he is tin- society
leader, t!i-- main politician, the chief new- organ, and
everything el e m tin- village. He comes to New Vork
oncea vear, buys a suit ??I the latest lollege rut, and
when he goes bai k home the rest of the population
its mouth in awe and gets off t ht ndewalk to 1 I

one of his produ? ttonf, the oiie-night-sta
looks at him condescendingly, blows some cigai -noke
in his direction, and bigins at on? C to lay down ab ?deal
