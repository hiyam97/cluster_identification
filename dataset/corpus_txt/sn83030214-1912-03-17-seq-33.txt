We could cut $500 out of the Haynes
and no one but an expert would know it
THAT doesn'l mean it couldn't be fou in! oui later on. Por il would be, and "later on"
is not a good lime to find oui thing- aboul the car you buy.
Pintl out before you buy.
It's a far/, we could cul the heart righl oui of the Haynes and few men could I ell
it by looking al the car. It might still be just as big and handsome. Bui it wouldn't
have the stiitj ?n il the materials and the workmanship. It would nol represent what
we consider necessary efficiency in an automobile.
There is nothing simpler than to cheapen a ear. Take fifty dollars off lure, twenty
five there, forty somewhere ?lse. and so on in a dozen ways and places. Easy enough
to buy inferior materials, rush the workmanship, cul oui the days and days of testing,
and let the Ixxly go through with six or ? ven coats of finishing instead of eighteen.
Bui to build a i ?tr thai way wouldn't be the Haynes way, and such a ear wouldn't
be a Havne car,
