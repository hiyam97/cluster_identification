walked on in nknee beside Merry until thry
came oat on the thick green turf about the

porch, an<l to her Miss Penelope spoke in her
low, clear voice.
PAN you Ml me if Mr. James Biompto,

win answer to her suspicions by on? bold
question. This woman with the strong
kindly face must Ik' Mrs. Brofflpton. She
had asked; hut in her mind she was quite
convinced.
The woman leaned on her broom and re
garded the slight, fair 1 aired woman in the
riding habit curiously. "He did," she said'
"but he doesn't now. You, pen, w\ ? an'

The brows of the woman n the porch
drew together in a little worn..': ??
"That's just what's bothering us all," she
said. "Of course, when Mr. Brootptoa a ?
killed," Miss Penelope gave a litt!.- .
exclamation; bul the woman had i
ticed, "Mrs. Bron pton just stayed on here;
but she never was strong, and sh<

"II?. w was Mr. Brompton killed ?"
Miss Penelope a little unsteadily. Ilei heart
was hounding at a sudden gUl
licious possibility, a possibility that t?jok her
breath away; l?ut she would not w< li omeit

"He was thrown from hi replied
the neighbor, "and it killed hin. ti
