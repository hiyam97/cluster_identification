THE PLAYFUL PICCANINNY
BY DR. RALPH ST. J. PERRY
TY> the children of Africa play games?
***' Sure they ?lo. Many of theiii are like
those played by American children; but
there are quite- a few that are distinctly
African in origin which I have never seen in
this country.
( >ne of the most popular is hong bayamy,
or monkey trap. Twenty, more or less, boys
join hands and sing a song about a monkey
being caught in a trap, dancing in a circle as
they sing. When they reach that part of
their song story where the monkey tries to
escape, they stop circling, and the youngster
who has been chosen by lot to impersonate
the monkey tries t?, break the circle by
lunging against the joined hands, while the
boys in the ring try to throw him on his back
by swinging their arms when he jumps on
them. This is to represent the monkey
jumping against the ropes of the trap and
being thrown back therefrom.
Should the monkey succeed in breaking
the circle and escaping, the person releasing
his hold must in turn Become monkey, while
the escaped boy takes a place in the ring.
Should he fail to break the circle, he is al?
lowed t'> rest, being supposed to lie ex
hausted. The song then continues, and tells
how he tries to jump over the rope that
holds him, only to lind himself still fastened.
To illustrate this the ?boys each throw one
leg over th?.' circle of hands, thus straddling
their arms, and while in this attitude jump
up and down three times. This is then re?
peated with the other leg. If any boy falls
or breaks his hold, he is regarded as having
set the monkey free, and must take his place
in the trap. The game begins atU'W with
each monkey.
T.\ "choosing out" in this and similar
* games the method most commonly used
is that of choosing hands, one hand holding
a 11? Mile, the other empty. The one hold?
ing the pebble after all have chosen is "it,"
either* "leader" oi^'goat." Each player before
choosing recites the following rigmarole.
Too too pr-r-rata,
'I',,., too pr-r-rata,
Mario monda bedoda,
Kehl Keh!
The first two* lines an- to represent the
sound of squeezing a broken orange or lime,
the h.mds being squeezed while they are
n cited. Tlie third line reads, " I do not like
any hand but this one!" and at "Keh! Keh!"
the player slaps the i hosen hand.
Tii i\V \.\\V i played along the same general
*?* lines a- the American game of "follow
your leader." Then- isa leader chosen, and
all other players must do and say just what
It is a game well alculated to cul?
tivate a child's memory and the powers of
observation. Hah" a dozen or so children
squat round a large -tone, which, when the
open . they all lift together by placing
their fingertips underneath it, slowly up and
slowly down, while they chant:
Zi?-? -? -?? now belang;
/..--i -??-<? now ti >kay.
' Lift this ro? k i:p -lowly;
Lay this rock down gently.)
After this the leader makes certain ges
tun . touches several players, and speaks a
number of w?.nb. Each player must repeat
all of thisexai tly, and in the sanie order and
manner as done by the leader. Should any
player fail, he is placed upon his hand- an i
kin ? , and the leader gives him from four to
ten Mow- on the back, always slapping his
back first, and again before the last blow,
: given with extra force. While doing
this he sings:
Zecly! Ping, ping, ping, ping,
Z.ely! Ping!
"Ze?ly" stand for the sound of the slaps,
and "ping" for that of the blows, usually
five. The leader may make as many and
such signs over the victim's back as he
, which each player must repta' ex*
a? tly when he pound ? the victim, and failure
to do so eau es him to take the forfeiter's
OY-YE-YE i- a boys' game, though
girls frequently play it. Each player,
eing usually from six to a dozen, takes
a rock, tin- lea.1er having a larger one than
then?, and the rocks I from

The passing of the roela takes pI.-(., g| the
