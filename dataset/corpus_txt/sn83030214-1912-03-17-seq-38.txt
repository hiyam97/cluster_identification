pushing very little. Ever and anon he
would stop and fed his pigtail in make sure
nothing had happened to the sacred append?
age. It was a question of theology that
bothered his pagan mind. Quite manifestly
the yaU'kvfti who came in the last night's
dream had warned Hung to get a haircut.
Milt who had sent the demon.'
X/IRS. OLIVER decided after lunch to
iVA take the afternoon train for San Fran?
cisco and go to the theater with her sister.
She often did this, the regular family
arrangement being for the Judge to drive
her tn the station and leave the horse and
cart at a local livery stable awaiting her re?
turn un the midnight train. The Judge
usually walked the three miles back to the
ranch.
"Cm hitch Daisy t" 'he red Duckboard,"
commanded the Judge of Bung, win? was
digging postholcs in half-hearted fashion.
"Yep, Boss!" replied the melancholy ser?
vitor. Then- was a long standing feud be?
tween Bung and the ?.Id sorrel mare, a dis?
pute made doubly irritating from the fact
that Daisy instinctively realized that Bung
was afraid ?if her.
"Whoa-up! Whoa-up!"commanded Hung
as he sidled into the Stall with ?ollar and
luidle. The auburn stud looked insolently
round to determine what she should " Whoa
up" for. As he nervously adjusted the ?ol?
lar over her shoulders she lirmight down her
hoof sharply within an inch of hi-, toe, caus?
ing the ??Id man to jump as though he had
been stung by a wasp. Just as he was re?
covering him ilf -he ?lapped him in tin* face
with her tail. Sin- presented a front of hypo
i ritual gentleness while he was removing
lu r halter; Imt the moment he seized her
forelock to force the Int in her teeth, she
suddenly elevated her head after the fashion
of a giraffe, backing away at the same mo?
ment and dragging Hung half the length of
the stable.
-oh. h?lice! Hos, ?lazy fool all time!"
ejaculated Hung, attempting to bridle the
?teed by the very force of bis fury. Por a
time a prodigious racket of howls and tramp?
ing hoof, shook tin- walls of tie table. I'

venus to the bone, and Gertrude, as si
gazed in panic from her liedrootn windoi
felt she* had much rather lie boiled in
nice, clean vat of olive oil than face tl
haughty heiress thus, in a s?-rvantless hous
hair down her back, and wearing a SOtk
kimono.
The elegant Miss Holland rang twice I
the hell, and looked slightly irritated at til
slowness of response. Hung, driving th
white hen, passed her once. With th
stealth of a stalking tiger Gertrude scuttle
to a siik- window mar which Hung, all ol
livious, stood panting from his lal>ors.
"Hung!" me whispered.
?Yep, Missy Geltlude."
"Sh-h-h! Come ?loser! There's a youn
lady i ailing, and no servants to let hern
Cm around to the kitchen and open the fron
door understand?"
"Yep. I sabe plenty. You say go loun
to kitchen and open flout door.'1
Gertrude closed the window softly. .
moment later she nearly fainted when sh
beheld Hung walk boldly up to the fron
veranda and thus address the daughter c.
tin- prune plutocrat:
"Missy Geltlude say nobody can let yo
in. So you please go lotuid to kitchen an
open flont door."
Tableau!
"My dear," warhled Gertrude with
forced* smile as she opened the door in he
deshabille, "1 hope you won't think we'v
all gone crazy the way our poor old servan
has."
"These Chinese!" exclaimed Miss Ho]
land, as if to say, "My father can affoti
English servants, you know."
Things, however, are never so had as the;
might to he. Gertrude was able to explaii
away the confusion with a hundred short
order ex? uses, skilfully served. Moreover
Miss Holland was not a had soft, under he
gilded exterior; and when it turn??! out tha
she had come to take Gertrude to an informa
house party overnight at the Hollan?
ranch, the latter girl accepted with all th?
enthusiasm ?,f her dan? ir.g teens. She left ?
note for her father pinned to his chair in th?
itting room, and the two girls, now arrayei
in almost equal splendor, drove away by th?
I. ? Road.
Bung continued to dig posthotes.
T\ defiance of all precedent, Judge Olivei
*? was driven back from the station in B
livery rig. He looked unnaturally 1 ?? -nt an?:
tired. Hung had to help him down from the
-<at, and he groaned a he itepped, leaning
heavily on the shoulders of the Chines?
henchman. Hung maintained a tactful
ill ti. i ; for he knew his boss was sufferins
from another it! ' of sciatica and would

The Julge found Gertrude's note on the

"It' a wond? r ' oth the girls have to go
