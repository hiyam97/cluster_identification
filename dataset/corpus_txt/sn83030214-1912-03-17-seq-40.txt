TRIALS OF A THEATRICAL MANAGER
Con'inwd from page 10
he meant me; so I went over, offered
hand, BUK. asked him what all the exc
menl was about.
"This is a tine triik you've played on a
he shunted. "I )" you think I'm going to
you play in my theayter with a cheap sec?
company, after yun promised me I'd get
original ?>r? h Im tion?
I tried to calm him; but he would i
li ?ten to me.
"When I hunk a New York company
want a New York company, and not a tea
rate road company!" he yelled.
And -would you believe it.- il took
two noun and three cigars to convince tl
manager that, as my play had not yet pla\
either in New York or in any other city,
was getting the only "original compati
thai ever existed. Smile ? ?ne-Iligllt -Sta
managers remind me of nothing su much
peacocks with dynamite bombs and arj
tnents strapped to their tails.
T REMEMBER a case in point that ?
curred a number of years ago when
was taking the original tank melndrat:
"The Dark Secret," through the one-nii
stands of the South. When we got to
small town in Alabama we discovered tl:
the theater was over a hig drygoods sto
W?' ^nt to town early in the morning ar
going directly to the theater, had the 1
water tank placed in position "tl the sta,
Ouradvent had been heralded tur weeks
advance by the manager of the theati
who had plastered the town with bills rea
ing, "Pour thousand tons of real water <
the stage at one time." ? ?f course, as tl
was the first time real water had be?
used in a play, and as one of the actors,
was advertised, had to dive into the tank
effect a rescue 'luring the progress of tl
drama, the town Hocked to the boxoffii
and bought all the tickets in the rack
le>s than no time.
Pour hours before the performance wi
ilii'luled to begin the manager of the th
ater came dashing into my room at the hi
tel, i lying out that the dam had hurst,
wa - inn-. The tank had broken, and tl
drygoods store below had been flooded,
"It ain't the drygoods store I'm thinkii
.ilmiit. though," -"Mied the manager.
"Tlun what i ? it?" I begged.
"Why, it's my reputation! If 1 get all tl
townsircoplc into the theater to see the sli? ?
after I've advertised four thousand tuns?
real water on the >tage, and then don't sho
Yin any nal water, they'll never come t
my theater again. I'm ruined, I till yoi
I'm ruin? d!"
After I had dried his tears for him, I su{
i that in such a ease tin- only thing t
In- ?lone was to can? el the performant e an
refund the money. He broke "tit cryin
??? h at the v< ry idea of (riving hack all th
money 'hat was airead) reposing snugly i
th,- lu.y.tiii. ufe.
"Well, then, if von don't wanl to fool th
village! till want to keep their monej

him.

into a discusMon of the weather, how y?
slept last night, what you think of Root
velt, or how you liked Mrs. So and S<
latest novel, which, he confidentially assur
you, would make a mighty fine play.
After you have politely suggested to hi
that just because you area theatrical man
<r,er he must not think you have not hin?;
ilo hut deposit money in the hank, he COI
soins to tell you his business. His husine
is a flexible affair.
1*11 give you a partial list of these "bttl
nesses as I tabulated them during "in sti
?xk- week's time not Ion? ago in my oth?
Here it is: To get Hie to prepare ?lata <
the American drama to he use?l by the call
in a lecture he was to deliver before a pi
vat?- dramatic club; to get my help in advi
ing his society how to go about instituto
a dramatic censorship; to pay a taller
relative two hundred dollars in advtuM
royalties on a play I had never seen <
heard of; to make a round of the theate
with some college student investigators an
determine to what extent the sp?cul?t?
nuisance existed; to join a society for tl
advancement of "billboard art"; to sul
-i ni?- one hundred dollars t?. a newl
formed "organization for the reading (
plays of unknown American dramatists'
to write a five-thousand-word artille t?, 1
read at a < htm h sociable the next i venin
on "the defects in our national dramatic 1er
delicies"; and to subscribe money to hi 1
mit a dramatic club in a high school in
small town in Connecticut. There wet
many other applicants during 'his sam
week; hut I have told you enough to allot
you to guess the nature of the rest.
It is a curious fact that so many person
believe a theatrical manager is a cross Ik
tu??n an information bureau and a publi
hank. I have never linn able to accoun
forit. An 1 yet it remains that a person wh
pays two dollars t<? see one of your play
somehow or other imagines he has done yot
a personal favor and that you owe him som
of your time an?! money in return. Th
lutter the play i> and the more he has en
joyed it. the more he thinks you ought t.
take him roun?l the corner and buy him ?
meal. It is less a question of psychology
than of Dementia Audiencia.
DEPORE concluding my s??n.'irio of ;
manager's trials, tribulations, and ?on
trilntte-relations, let me add a few word:
alxiut another element that goes to make I
theatrical producer's life something les:
carefree and easy than thai of a professiona
. otillion leader. I refer t?. the a. tor jol
hunter-. Tammany Hall the morning aftel
election looks like a deserted island com?
pared t.. a theatrical manager's office anj
day in the week. For every position in a
manager's companies there are something
like one hundred applii ants, and tl e ninety
nine who do not gel the job hurry out on
Hi Iway and begin calling you nan
?;,. '..?i .if their \
The job hunters try every conceivable
way t.. gel a personal hearing with a mana?
ger. I have known one of them, a young
woman, to pretend she had sprained her
ankle in tripping over one of the outer office
that she might thus win a
littl ympathy and mayhap a little job
along with it- from m?-. I have known ac?
to li?' in wail for a manager for days at
a time, in hotels, tl caters, omi es, on the L
ns, and elsewhere in order t?i get his
car on tin jubjei ' "fa position. Soi

I was coming out early in the

:" my bn akfast table newspaper, next
to the theatrical news, 1 once discovered a

that he lad paid the delivery hoy a dime
? ? the letter inside the paper with a
f mucilage. On another occasion, three
months ago, I was awakened in the middle
?if tie night by a ring on the telephi ?ne. The
\..i. i- at the ..th?T end said its owner had
irrived ?n town from the West and
wanted to kii"W whether any positions in
my companies wireopi n. I get appliiati< tis
