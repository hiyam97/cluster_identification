WHEN ALGY WAS IN LINE
BY SEWELL FORD
"Ciimc. Deary. FU Y.iur Side Comb, and Tr.it Into the Private Office.''
K'l) had Algy much as five or six we? '
he'd come to lie a reglar standin' joke here
;ii the Corrugated. You know. Every l>ig
office lias mie lliat's as much a part of the fixtU
the copy press ..r the spring water tank. They come
in bandy, too, keepin' the force cheered up on ?lull
? lays, and actin* as snrt oft escape valves l"r all the
cheap humor that can't In- unloaded on any..ne dse.
How Algy ?\. i dodgl I luin' a man milliner or a floor
walker in the cloak and sut! department. I couldn't tig
ure ou! : for he had ..11 the points. ? ?tie of ih.-se mushy
liHikin'. s.i? spoken, biscuit haired, white Hvered, young
wrist slappere, Algy was; will, a complexion as ruddy
as a pail <?t lard, skim-milk blue eyes, and a se! ??? par
lor manners that was as (???kI a, a correspondence
imirse in etiquette jusl t.. watch.
Up and down then- was quite a loi to Algy; bul he
was thickest through at about the point where his
throat apple bulged through his white wings collar.
And in his |..n? sack coal and narrow patent leather
shoes lie certainly was ornamental t.. have around the
oHi? e.
It wai Old Hickory's ??dea of bavin* a man stenog?
rapher added to the staff. As he explains careful to
Piddie, there was times when he jus! naturally had to
cuss durin' business hours, and, while some of the lady
typists was fairly well broke in, he couldn't always do
justice to his feelin's with them takin1 dictation. So he
give! Olden tO take on a man shorthand expert, that
wouldn't turn pink ?and wallow his gum when he really
? 111 1? Mise.
And Piddie, who's got a head on him like a lima bean
well, he pirks Algy for th.- job. I'irst mornin1 he
-hows up at the ?gate and announces who he is I could
hardly believe it.
?Hone ,/" savs I. "Why, you bold thing! Sure you
ain't mistook this for a mother's help 'sit 'J"
Algy, h. only smiles kind of wear) and asks where he
shall hang up his hat and ? oat.
"Ladies' i I oak room to the right, men's t.? the left,"
I. "Take your i hoi. e, Algy."
Hm there's no gettin1 a rise out of him, though. 1
tried him mit good ?and plenty thai first week without
rufflin* a feather, ami you .an l?t if the iahs I sent in
didn't gt't home, mithin' l/./.ie Hiulheitner and them
other flatheads could think up would have any effect.
Por, in spite of his meek ways, Algy had a hide like a
sole leath.i trunk. Seemed like he was used t.? thai
sort of joshin' and didn't mind it any more. Algernon
Rogers Pratl was the name he registered with 'he cash?
ier; but h.'il answer t<? Mis. Pratt, <.r Algy dear, just
?? rful as he would t.. anything else.
"Come, I learv," IM say to him, "fix your side comba
and trot into th. private office: Mr. I'.ilins is ready for
>Ol|."
And I wouldn't get BO much as a pout from him. So
Of COUrse as a -?ike he got a little tame to me.
UE wa'n't a joke to u|?i Hickory, though. He was
**? just a disappointment. I didnl tumble t<> how the
Loss was takin AlgV for near a week, either, and then
.?ne day I happened t?. be in at the desk just as Algy
gathers up his notebook and glides out. Old Hickory
turns and glares after him .savage, and then rips out a
few atmosphere scorchers that almost blisters the var?
nish.

w
?phew!" ays he, stoppin' t?>r breath. "I've been
keeping all thai bottled up for the last hour. Torchy,
where in the merry Mithridates < 1 ?< 1 Mr. Piddie ever
find such a limp spincd specimen?"
"Who, Algy? sa\s I. "Why, ! hat's his idea of a man
stenographer, 1 ?
"Hull!" snorts Mr. EUins. "That isn't ?i man: that's
a paniilv. He ought to be wearing a tube -kirt and
dome fancywork. Why, when he's in here I don'l feel
thai I can even say dam, and it's getting on my nerves."
<)1?1 Hickory mus? have lei oui some of this in other
quarters too, rudgin1 by the way Piddie proceeds to nil?
ii into Algy every ? hance he gets. Course, the thing to
do was to give him the chuck first payday; but, .is I
understands it, Mr. Bllins won't have that. He sticks
oui for a straight deal towards the help, Old Hickory
does, and one of the red ink rules of the Corrugated is
that nobody j'(',s the can tied to 'em unless they've
earned it good and proper. Personal "{Touches don'l
?mint with him, and he ?follows his own dope.
But, say, between Piddie goin' sour on him thai way,
and all the r.st of us usiu' him as a comic feeder, Algy's
workin' hours couldn't hav.- been a dream of delight.
He don'l squeal, though, or even so much as run out
his tongue by ?Tray of gettin' back at us; and I don't
know as you can blame us much if we kin?l of j^ot into
the habil of treatin1 him as if he wa'n'1 exactly human.
You know how it is- All I could sn- to Algy was a sort
of livin' machine that could take dictation like a stre.ik
and thump a typewriter until hi- almost had
the liearin s hoi. That he might have a home
somewhere, ami relations, ami private ??leas
of his own al><>ut things, never struck me
until
VT7ELL, if was "tie afternoon here a week
or so ago. IM jumped out on the
stroke of live and was tWOblocks awav before
I remembers about an extra bunch of letters
Piddiehad told me special to dump in tin
substation. So it was a case of Matin' i:
bock and gettin' 'em. The scrubwoman wi
already on the i..l> as I got of! at our Roo
luit there wa'n't anyone else in sight.
That is, I didn't see anyone as I dashc '?
in. and I'd grabbed the letters and v;
turnin* to rush out again, when ?.ver m tl
corner I spits this grief spectacle. It's Algy
slumped forward on his little typewrit r
talile, his head between his arms, and hi
shoulders lu-avin' up and down from deep
emotion. Course, I couldn't resist a goo!
chance like that.
"Well, well''- layi I. "Workin* the sprink
1er, eh? How harrowin'!"
Algy, he straightens up for a second a*,
thai, and when he's seen who it is he caves
in again. Hut it's long enough for me to see
I was wrong on the sprinkler guess. How?
?ever bod he felt, he wa'n't lea km' any brine
over it.
"I_i|oyin'a dry one, ch.J" says I. "Well,
what'- happened HOW? Some of the lady
typists been actin'catty?"
* Please. Torchy!" says he, shakin' his head
?ad "I-I don't wish to t;il!< aU.ut it.
"Ah. it'll do you ?risul to >-et it out ut y ? .'
-ays I. "Come on, now, who's behavi
Piddie t><*tn naggin' again?"
"<Oi, 1 don't mind Mr. Piddie," ?ays -V. ii
isn't fair, that's all. Hut Mr. Ellin. lud no
right t?> say it."
"(?M Hickory, eh?" -ays I. "Oh, I van eu? >. S?.>me*
thing went wrong, I expect, and he turned the lun?l
language. Tore <-tT some real naughty w<
Algy nods. "Never in all my life," lu- :
ever hear su. h
"Well, you stick around tin- Con .while
longer," I ?breaks in, "and you'll hear mon
you care. He don'1 mean anything by it."
"Mut I didn't care," rays Algy. "il w
giring afterward that hurt."
"Whe-e-e-ew!" says I. "Old Hickory ai> '
he?"
"Not in fun, either," complains Ais le die
meant it. Apologized to me just a- il !
but I'm not going in stand it. I'm -roil e '
all!"
"Stop your Iriddin', Algy," says I. "Y<
want t" break his hearl that way."
"<)h, i know," says Algy, real ?bitter. "I
I've always been a joke. Hut I'm throu ne.
I'll show him, .ni'! everyone else! They'll I'm
going t?i ? leaf out now and do what I've .,! .?

"Eh?" says I. "Hadn't heard ?of her bei i

"Why not?" demand** Algy, stiffenii
AND when ['d caught my breath on

t.iils. And, say, folks k?'' queer quirks, don' ' I
expect l??ts nf us has some snealrin* idea thai lime
??r other we'll l.e this <>r that; an idea thai
tucked away private and don't often talk I-?-1
Algy as a cowboy! Can you surroun
"How Ions jrou been fecdin' this bug?" lays !
"Why, a ions time," says Algy. "I !?.?;.in '
aboul it when I was clerking in the stor?-."
"Aha!"savsl. "I knew: Ribbon counter,
"Why, all iiver," says Algy. "You see, 1'
tn have ,i little fancy goods store mi I25tl
when he die?! Mother kept it on, with Aunty I help
I iras brought up in the -tore, as you migl 1
didn'i want to be a clerk; but there was n?> ???? ? A
boy <?f ten can't say what he'll do. I had ratl i ve
been '?ut playing with the "tlnr fellows, '
tiny wouldn't let me. He-ides, they needed me t? '?I?
in the store. Yes, I've sold ribbon, miles of it;
and corsets, and hosiery, and embroidery silk- And
I've been days almost without -peaking to .. DOJ X ??
man just women. Mut I couldn't help it, I t> '.'
I hated it, hated it'"
I wouldn't have thought, either, that Algy could look
s?? tiene, or thai In- had such ?i deep voice.
"I used to re.nl and think and dream about l?inn
something different," he goes on. "I ?wanted to live
out in the open air, o it m the sun an 1 wind and rain,
