THE LOST WORLD

business. There were one or two folk who were inclined to take him
seriitti.lv; hut he soon choked them off."
"How?"
" Will, by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior. There was
poor old Wadlcy of the Zoological Institute. Wadley sent a message,
'The president of the Zoological Institute presents his compliments to
Professor Challenger, and would take it as a personal favor if he would do
thctn the honor to come to their next meeting.' The answer was un
printable."
" Y<>u don't say!"
"Well, a Bowdlerized version of it would run, ' Professor Challenger pre?
sents his compliments to the president of the Zoological Institute and
would take it as a personal favor if he would g? to the devil!'"
"Good Lord!"
"Yes, I expect that's what old Wadlcy said. I remember his wail at
the meeting, which began, 'In fifty years' experience of scientific inter?
course ' It quite broke the old man up."
"Anything mon- aboul Challenger?"
"Well, I'm a bacteriologist, you know. I live in a nine-hundred
diameter microscope. I can hardly claim to take serious notice of any?
thing that I can see with my naked eye. I'm a frontiersman from the
extrnne edge of the Knowablc, and I feel quite out of place when I leave
my study and come into touch with all you great, rough, hulking
creatures. I'm too detached to talk scandal, and yet at scientific con?
versaziones I have heard something of Challenger; for he is one of those
men whom nobody can ignore. He's as clever as they make 'cm, a full
charged battery of force and vitality; but a quarrelsome, ill conditioned
faddist, and unscrupulous at that. He had gone the length of faking
some photograph over the South American business."
" You say he is a faddist. What is his particular fad?"
"He has a thousand. Hut the latest is something about Weissmann and
evolution. He had a fearful row about it in Yienna, I believe."
"Can't you tell me the point?"
"Not at the moment; but a translation of the proceedings exists. We
have it filed at the office. Would you care to come?"
"It's just what I want. I have t.. interview the fellow, and I need some
lead up to him. It's really awfully good of you to give me a lift. I'll
go with you now, if it is not too late."
TJTALF an hour later I was seated in the newspaper office with a huge
tome in front of me, which had been opened at the Article "Weiss
mann versus Darwin." with the subheading, "Spirited Protest at Vienna.
Lively Proceedings." My scientific education having been somewhat
neglected, I was unable to follow the whole argument; but it was evident
that the English professor had handled his subject in very aggressive
fashion, and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental colleagues. "Pro?
tests," "Uproar," and "General appeal to the chairman" were three- of
the first brackets which caught my eye. Most of the matter might have
been written in Chinese, for any definite meaning that it conveyed to
my brain.
" I wish you could translate it into English for me," I said pathetically to
my helpmate.
"Well, it is a translation."
"Then I'll try my luck with the original."
"It h certainly rather deep for a layman."
" If I could only gel a single good meaty sentence which seemed to con?
vey some sort of definite human idea, it would serve my turn. Ah, yes,
this one will do. I seem in a vague way almost to understand it. I'll copy
it out. This shall be my link with the terrible professor."
"Nothing else I can do?"
"Well, yes, I propose to write to him. If I could frame the letter here,
and use your address, it would give atmosphere."
"We'll have the fellow round here, making a row, and breaking the
furniture."
"No, no, you'll see the letter?nothing contentious, I assure you."
"Well, that's my chair and desk. You'll find paper there. I'd like to J
censor it before it ^oes."
It took some doing; but I flatter myself that it wasn't such a bad job
when it was finished. I read it aloud to the critical bacteriologist with
some pride in my handiwork:
