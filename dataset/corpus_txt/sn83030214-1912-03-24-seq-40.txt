WEALTH IN OYSTER SHELLS
BY RENE BACHE
*W7HEN a man chops 08 the butt end <?
** boiled egg at the breakfast table,
?hardly occurs to him to think that he is ?le,
fang With a marine product, and yet the ef
so far as its shell is concerned, is likely to a
swer to that description, inasmuch as t
lime of which it is composed may have be
originally separated from sea water by ;
oyster.
Vast quantities of oyster shells are gn All
up for chicken feed, and are forwarded
this shape by the tens of thousands of bus
els t.. the Middle West, 'he great egg pr
du. ing redim? of the world. Factories 00 I
Chesapeake and alon^ t h?- ( iulf Coast hand
thai! in this way, reducing them to mi
scraps in machines somewhat like n_
crushers, though much less in size. Final
they are put up in bags for shipment, tl
limy dust incidentally produce? 1 beii
thrown away.
This ?lust will likely In- .?.ved asa valuafa
byproduct a few years from now, in ..We?
ence to the growing economic tendency
turn all sorts of waste tu useful account. _
for the broken oyster shells, they nappe-,
commercially not only as eggshells, but ah
as chicken bones,actuallv furnishing maten
for the skeletons of millions on millions ?
the fowls that come to market.
VET it was only twenty years ago th.
oyster shells were regarded as of less th.
no value, and the packing companies engage
in canning the "meats'" had much trouble 1
dispose i if them. When they could nut ?i\
them away, they pai?l money to have th.-i
carted off and romped. In 18(.H) the ma
kennen of Baltimore paid twenty thouSB?
dollars to get rid of oyster shells, the sect
mutation of which was a perpetual and .-v.
increasing nuisance.
Since then, however, it has l>een disco.
ered that oyster shells should be regarde
rather as an asset than a_ a liability. 1
1888 the wholesale ihucken at Baltimoi
were getting half a cent a bushel for thei
shells, an?I since then the price has ri.ci
until now this long despised article 0. tnci
chandise commonly brings a cent and a ha]
a bushel. The shells are shipped by thou
lands of tons from Maryland to otIn?
states, where they are used for makiti;
roads, in the manufacture of carbonic a.-i?
gas, in the production of special grades >?
iron, and for railroad be.is. For the las
purpose they serve almost as well as stone.
One sees workmen mixing mortar for ;
building that is going up. The lime put int?
it (an essential constituent) is derive?! froo
oyster shells. Fences and outhouses an
painted with whitewash, a substance th?
verv name of which has come to have a pe?
culiar significance as implying eleanlines.
and the effective discouragement of germs
Whitewash, of course, is merely oyster shell:
in solution.
HPHK most important use of oyster shells
1 however, is for cultch (the term applia
to material put into the water for youni
oysters to grow uj>on). At present the bull
of the oyster shells produced in the waters n!
New York, Connecticut, and Long Island i:
turned to account in this way. The sh.lh
are dumped upon the bottom in June, when
the spawning season of the oyster is begin?
ning, anil invite the baby bivalves to settle
Upon them.
'1'he procese might be like-ned to scattering
corncobs over dry land with the expectation
of picking up ripe ears in full grain a few
months later. By the- adoption of this
method not less than one-third of the entire
bottom of the great estuary known as Long
Island Sound is made t?? yield as regular a
crop as any farming land; thousands of
acres being used exclusively for the pro?
duction of seed oysters, which, when grown
to the si/.e of one's thumbnail, are dredged
up and planted in other places, to mature
ami reach marketable size. Some of the
subaqueous farms in the sound are eight
miles from shore an? I at a depth of eighty
fce-t.
Fresh or -?reen oyster shells are not suit?
able for employment as . ultch. They are
likely to be more or less coated with marine
algai, which render them slimy, so that the
free-swimming baby oysters cannot take
firm hold. For this reason it is customary to
keep the shells for a year or more, expexsed in
heaps to the air, at the end of which time
they are clean, bright, and ready for use.
The annual output of oyster shells in this
country is twenty-five miliion bushels. It is
reckoned that the shells landed on the shores
of Maryland alone during the last hundred
years have amounted to thirteen million live
hundred thousand tons, a weight far greater
than the combined tonnage of all I am
vessels in the world. An?l yet all of this im?
mense mass of material was
by the humble mollusks from |

substance of which the shells an -'.most

WHEN THE LIMITED SLOPS
HPHI. dogs of the few-and-far-between vu
**? lages of Western Pesai are the
sessors, perhaps through necessity.
precocity thai affords the weary t.
the transcontinental Pullman some enter?
tainment as pleasurable as it is brief.
'flu- through trains .top at most of I
towns, many of which are from tw, ? I
hours' run apart. As the engine '
and begins t.. .low down the dogs of the
town start m an animate?! tr??t for tl __?
tion. 'flu- animated trot is in itself
thing worth seeing; for Tesas dog
ically lazy.
When the train comes t?i a stop th trav?
eler will see th.- ?lo^s lined up along ? le the
dining car, their gaze fixed expectantly on
exactly the proper ?window; m other _"r_s,
the kit.-lien window. They slowly ?rag their
tails and wait. The chef and his help know
the dogl are there, and presently some
choice scraps of eatable-s are thrown out.
Than there is S scramble, and the lucky ?l?>g
bolts his treasure at a gulp. It is S good
naturel scramble, however, BO fightS?
only a few harmless growls and whines.
Before the- train pulls <mt each dog usually
manages to get ? bite <?r two. If one sett
left out he- waits for the next train with a
diner.

station t.. mc.-t the- Pullman .?mers. Strange
to Say, there seems to be- DO bitte-r enmity
between the dogs and the hogs, both take
their chatic.-s with philosophic equanimity;
the dogs, of course, getting a little the better
of the deal. But occasionally a hog gets a
mouthful, and when it does it scurries away
as though it felt that its patience and vigi?
lance had been amply re-warded.
When the train gets into Louisiana the
town stops are diversions of a elifferent va?
riety. The little piccanmies know the run?
ning schedule as well as the engineer or con?
ductor, and when the train stops ?obey are
