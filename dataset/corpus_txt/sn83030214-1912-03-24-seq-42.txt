A SENSE OF HUMOR
By J. EARL CLAUSON
A SELF tyled student of human natui
?**? has what he is pi? s ?? ! to call his ad
t?-st for s sense <>f humor. Il con ists ?>t
urtain story, of whose mirth provokin
quality he is so well convinced that to tin
it other than a laugh compeller is to argtj
on? elf not of the elect. The tale runs s
tollo'.'
I he undertaker was preparing the n
mam; of the ?very bald man !'?r mtermen
,\s he ?ras busy at tin* congenial ta.sk th
bereaved widow stole into the room.
"I have brought you a p??t of glue," h
sobbed.
"Why, what is that for?" inquired th
master of ceremonies in ome astonishment
"!? occurred to me," she explained, "tha
you might need it for attaching poor John1
t. .11*. < -.
" I hat's very thoughtful of you," said th
undertaker in his mosl sympathetic tonet
"but you m ??'! not have bothered. 1 hat.
? oupk of ta
Now, whethi r or not I tunny st?.r\
it i ..ti interesting one b* reason of th
wid.lv different effeel il !..? upon hearer*
To mo ? the firsl .? n ation i- of outrage
hilities. Many never experience an;
othi r. A few suffer no qualm, but i
delight from the insl inl o? thi d?nouemenl
The proprietor of the tale argues that, ?i
with some cheeses, a little feeling of ronug
nan. e is < i ntiaJ to full enjoymenl of it
delicate davor. He i i willing t.. admit, net
ertheless, that tin- se.A humor is no
wholly absent even from those who sustaii
no hock. The unfortunate who are ad
indicated quite outside the pale are thos
individual, who bland?) ask whether th?
undertaker followed the u ual custom, o
any other equally unappreciative qu
They ?have tailed to real I to the test.
A SENSE of humor i one of the thing
***? we refer to in daily conversation, bu
find serious difficulty in denning. ? >n sonv
equally vague quahtics we possess compe
tent opinion .; ?m genii i -, for instance, aboui
which critics have always differed and al
ways will, yet which the one umversaU]
acknowledged genius of the English mee as
? ?thing "to madness near al
lied." Bui you shall search in vain for ai
explicit and authoritative comment on ?
".sense of humor." N?. maker of dictionaric
lias ?ver pretended to know what it is: ha?
he known he would perhaps have followe?
another calling. There is no history o\
humor in which you may trace the evolu
tion <>f this priceless p?..? ision from th?
seed to the ri[K> fruit of today. Perhapi
humor antedates history it ?elf, and was al?
ready in the Sower when a testy Babylonian
shattering ?on the soin I ivory skull ?of a fellow
citizen the baked brick that was the COOIM
weekly of his time, gave rise to the populai
phrase, "cracking ? |oke."
Nor will everyone agree with the s.-li
styled student 01 human nature as to tin
infallibility of his acid test Vet he is stand?
ing on tin- thre hold of a peat truth. Even
if there were no other evidence in support
of that contention, it is proved by the popu?
larity in America 0. what may be called
mortuary anecdotes, of which the foregoing
and the following are fair examples:
"^fks. BRONSON, a good hearted New
England woman with an ineradicable
weakness for the/esa pas, remarked one
afternoon to her daughter:
"I'm going ??ver to comfort Mrs. Drake.
You know Mr. Drake hanged himself in
their attic last night."
"oh, don't j-o, Mother!" protested the
younger woman. "You always say the
wrong thing."
"Yes, Mary, I feel it my duty to go," in?
sisted Mrs. Branson. "But I'll just talk
about the weather. That's a perfectly safe
?object."
Seated in Mrs. Drake's kitchen, she ven?
ture?!, "What rainy weather we have had
lately!"
"Yes, indeed." replied the widow. "I
haven't been able to get the week's wash
dried."
"Why, I shouldn't think you wotiM have
any trouble," Mrs. Branson returned. "You
have such a nice attic to hang things in."
I_fl'M?)R involves sentiment and charac*
**"** ter," wrote (liles. "Hutnorisofagcni.il
quality, ?lwelb in the same character with
pathos, and is always mingled with sensibil?
ity." Yet not sentiment, not character, not
even sensibility, is the dominant note of
American humor; but whimsicality, and a
sense of humor, as the phrase is understo<xl
here, involves, if it does not wholly consist
of, an appreciation of whimsicality. Hence,
Mich anecdotes as the foregoing. Death
always tragedy. To extract from it a latuj
involves whimsicality. ?Such an undertal
ing is characteristically American. Quei
epitaphs are K> well orne that one vaudevil
entertainer made them his stock in tra?
for years. Those be invented were neve
half s?, enthusiastically received by his ami
enees as the real one-- he quoted.
It is as impossible to manufacture tl
equal of an unconsciously funny epitaph ;
t?. perpetrate in cold blood anything con
parable with the phrasing of a set of resoh
tions adopted not many month?* ago by tl:
grammar school masters of one ui our largt
"Whereas, .Almighty God in His prov
dence, and as we beheveout of loving cai
for His children, has removed from our mid
by death thesupettntendentofourschools
or the enthusiastic assertion of an act?
whom the late Kirke La Shelle, the autha
observed was Wealing a mourning band 0
his arm.
"It's for my father,*1 the actor explainer
"I've ju-t ?come from his funeral."
La Shelle expressed hi? sympathy.
The actor's grief was obviously real an
great. "I attended to all the funeral arrangi
ment.," he laid. "We had everything jus
as Father would have liked it."
"Were then mair. there?" asked I..
Shelle.
"Were there?" eric! the actor with pridi
"Why, my boy, we turned them away!"
IT seems but yesterday when the anecdot
** ?if chara? ter had the right ?>f way in thes
United States. Together with the stag
Irishman and the mother in law wheeze, i
has passed , ,n and "Oh, the difference!" ti
all of us. For, whether or not the b'gosl
joke was true to lif?-, there was soniethiiij
distinctly ?livening about the figure it calle?
to min I.
Material for S whole vaudeville sketch
for instance, is suggested by the story of tIt?
rival poultry farmers who, meeting on tli?
highway, indulged in the following dialogue
Mornin', Si."
"Mornin*, Hi."
"Wha'd you give ?your chickens when the]
had the pip?"
"Tu'pentine."
"Mornin', Si."
"Mornin', Hi."
A week passed and they met again. Tin
conversation:
"Mi?ruin', Si."
"Mornin*, Hi."
"Wha'd you say you gave your chicken
when they had the pip?
. "Tu'pentine."
"Wal, I gave mine tu'pentine, 'nd they
died."
"So'd mine."
"I'ni-m-niotnin', Si."
"M< min', Hi,"
"DIT since the farmer has become the
most opulent member of our body poli?
tic and has bought a barnful of touring cars,
he 11 of as little actual use to the professional
funny man as?well, as a Waterbury watch.
Our colored brother still supplies a modicum
of innocent amusement, to be sure, and it
may pardonably be hoped that many a year
will pass before he becomes to?* sophisticated
to furnish such a tale as that of the old uncle
with strong ethical convictions, which Con?
gressman Nicholas Longworth tells.
This old negro was stopped in the street
on election day by a white man who asked
him whether he had ?rated.
"Vas, 'ndeed, I's voted," replied the
negro.
Did you get anything for your vote?"
"Oh, vas, Suh, 1 got paid for my vote."
"What did you gel ?"
uWell, Suh,'it was laik dis. De Republi?
cans come to me an' dey says dey give me
eleven dollahs if me and mail three boys
vote de Republican ticket, an' I tcx.k de
money. An' de Democrats come to me and
?ley says dey give me seven dollahs f<>' mah
vote and mah boys' vote, an' 1 took ?le
money. "
"You took money from both sides? Then
which ticket did you vote.'"
"Oh, I voted c?e Democratic ticket."
"Why so- The Republicans gave you the
most money."
"Vas, Suh, dat's why. I voted to' de
Democrats fo' jes' dat reason?dey wa'n't
as corrupt as de Republicans.''
UOWEVBR greatly taste may change,
* there will always be circulation for such
anecdotes as that of the old farmer drawn
for jury duty in Southern Missouri. He had
