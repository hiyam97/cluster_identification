Don't Pare Corns
With Steel
This cut shows a corn with the
pointed end digging into the nerves.
Paring that corn takes off just the
top layers, ar.d a few days brings
them back.
If yon pare t??o deep, ?>r the blade
?lips a trifle, it means an infection.
And blood poison <>ften results,
That is a ns?-le?-s, old -fashioned,
dangerous way to treat corn?-.
How to End Them
A Blue-jay plaster?applied in a
jiffy?means the end of the cum, root
and brauch.
The pain stops instantly. Then the
P k B was gently loOMOS the corn.
In two days the whole corn cernes out.
No pain, no sore?
ness. You apply the
plaster, then forget
the corn. In 48
hours it is ended for?
ever.
Nothing ever In
*?? ? ?1 does what
BI ne -jay does for
corns. Millions of
?people have found
thii out.
Won't you?
