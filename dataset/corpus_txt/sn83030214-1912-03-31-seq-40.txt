[TWO DOGS
AT the Green Room Club in New Yorl
?**? city, recently, someone started tellin
dog tone . Of course there were man;
?.-???d one ?: '?tit it -remained f??r II. A. I l'An ??
who wrote "The Poce <>n the Bar-roon
Floor," t?? tell these two unique
theatrical dogs he had known.
'"( ?ne aft?-ni??.il." said Mr. I )'.\r< \, '*! ha?
i company playing al Bay City, and was
taking ticK? ' al the matin?e performance
Two finely dressed young ladies a me to th<
door, and following them a handsome setter
? n'. ourse, the dog could nol lie admitted t?
the theater, and one <>t the ladies told him
to go back home. The animal tried very
hard to get past the gate several times; but
I I? I in blocking his passage. 11?
then settled down at the bottom <?f the
ind watched me intently. Time and
again when he saw a little rush of people he
tned t.. sneak l?y; bul was unsuccessful. I
suppo <? for upward <>f fifteen minutes the
watt lied and growled al me for not
letting him p
"An idea evidently struck him al la t.
He saw thai everylxxly that passed the gate
handed me what appeared tu !?<? a piece of
paper, There were several empty envelops
laying in the lobby, the same being ?li k arded
?pie who had secured their tickets in
advance. Eying me carefully, the beautiful
animal picked up <?n<" of the envelops and
timidly < reeping up the stairs ?.tiered me the
small piece of paper in his mouth. Well -
did he ?get in? I should say so! A doe, with
such intclligen e can have a private box or
a parquet seat from me al any time."
UIS nexl tory was <?f a prize winning dog
*?*? owned by Bertha Galland:
??When 'The Return of Eve' was first pro?
duced in \? w York, the handsome rnistre ;
? ? ? 1 on a part being written in for Ja< k.
Would il nol make a beautiful picture for
Eve and the dog to be lolling on the gra -
in Eden? Jack wa i duly rehear ?? -?I, an?l took
kindly to the role. He was always on tin
jot?, ,-md the stae,?' pi. ture wop, murmur; of
admiration from the audience every night.
After a few months, however, the tage m in?
ager discovered that Jack was taking too
much ? redit to himself; in short, ! ?
getting a swelled head. He would '?
away from hi po ition and ?20 down to the
footlighl -, pt.it! ?? and wag hi 1 tail and talk
to the audu n< -. Thi 1, ?-f ? ourse, interfered
with the .h tion of the s? ene. Remen tr?n, es
W( re '.t' no avail; for hi vanity rapidly in
"d.
"The climax came one night at Mon 1
After the fit I a? I I u k u 11 invited out with
other players to take the 'call.' Instead of
modestly retiring after the applau
: down to the footlights, and non
found himself out the drop curtain.
The hou e wa in an uproar of laughter, and
the ?zallen* gods tweeted, whistled, an
vised Jack to 'Sick 'em!' '?ne of the
hands was senl out to carry the dog 1
stage; l?ut the sight of a beautiful row of
teeth sugg? ?n. Jack then
in? lined t" run amuck through the audien? e.
Preparing to make a spring ov?_r th<
lights, ??tie of his paws struck an el
light bulb, which of course exploded. Pi
nallv Miss Galland herself was oblig? I "
<_-<) out in fronl of the curtain and take her
sixty-pound pel off. Jack I, and
after one or two parting barks at the g
made his exit lickinj lutiful face of his

Then- tvas a ship riding at anchoi

It was a ' trange place for a ship to ancho

jewel in my pocket. N'o open attempt t

A I entered the cottage old Agatha me
me with her finger on her lip. "She's sleep
in^ still," she whispered, "the ?poor lamb
She sobs a Lit like a baby when it's dreamin
and then --ink, off quiet again. Vou'd bes
t iki the bird out ot tli?- house, for fear th
squawkin' would wake her."
"What bird?" said I,
"The one in the Li^r: l>??x yonder. The ex
t? ght it from the train awhilt
ago."
I looked al it cunously, through tli?- slal
nailed a? ross the front. It was some variety
of large ea fowl, with a great beak tha
opciud and shut re ties ly. Was it sent L_.
; r>r foe?
The bird regai ' me v. ith an e*. il, sullci
??ye, as I sat reg rdii ? it, my head on mj
hand.
Then I fell it: the ti I I ttom ol
? a paper that t ? ? tin in
??. . ? : t wa there. It was in the
handwriting we had received
and finish? 1 with tl ? odd cun m^- line.
This ua the purport:
This messenger is s-nt to relieve you of your
charge, if you st-ll retain it. Give him nothing
to carry that could be found if he were de?
tained in his flight; but feed ham well, and let
him free on the last stroke of twelve.
That was all. \ bt lieve : that I ha I
tered the meaning. I looked at my ?.
?I wa nearly noon. I carried box and all to
? n , by the window, and
placed t!u- emerald among a handful of
broken pieces of bread. The bird eyed the
? light and sheered off suspiciously.
,'illage clock had begun striking. A
cold n ?: my brow. I tore oil
? . eized the bird in a fierce grip,
me ??own his ugly tl
?? >m the window
itroke died away. At the sam? nstanl
low, penetrating whistle sounded froi
on the water. The bird wheeled
. and then flew straight out toward
the ocean; but not before a feathered dart
'.wart its fli nd fell harmle ?
ground. The emerald was gone!
1 fell on my knees and wept a I had not
lone . ince 1 wa - a little child, with the re?
laxing of the awful strain. Then Pauline's
?*, faint voice called me.
\?V' ?'!' t'u' vi"a?s,(> t'1;d niK''?t, and w? n
** hack to town, and the elevated, an
the trolley, ;in<i the busy crowd, and th
comforting press of life. Hut it was wo I
before Pauline recoven I her strength, o
could speak of the ei Id without a fit o
tier ous shuddering.
W'v had jtirt begun to forget that evi
dream in the ab orbing <?? i upation of earn
?ng a living, with Pauline as ray Proteai
model,?when, one* morning as we sat ono

of stairs this time*, with a piarlo in full CT*

"What i ? ii, Dear.'" 11 ried, running to hei

She pointed to a paragraph in a *
-, an i I n id aloud:
Apropos of Continental gossip, the prol
absence of a certain famous jewel from the:
regalia of a S iveretgn Princess, who shall be
l?amele. , has occasioned many malicious re?
porta. Fortunately scandal was confuted by its
reappearance the other ??ay at a royal function.
That it has been the cause of an imbroglio deep
and far reaching, involving the honor of two
countries, remains, nevertheless, an open secret.
Was it oui raid? Pauline and I be?

And the : ? had dared
and suffered so much? We had all
given up any hope of it, when nearly a year
fterv ird I received a notice fron tl
Areopagan Hank that ten th tu and
