PERRYTY the children of Africa play games Sure they lo Many of theiii are likethose played by American children butthere are quite a few that are distinctlyAfrican in origin which I have never seen inthis country ne of the most popular is hong bayamyor monkey trap Twenty more or less boysjoin hands and sing a song about a monkeybeing caught in a trap dancing in a circle asthey sing When they reach that part oftheir song story where the monkey tries toescape they stop circling and the youngsterwho has been chosen by lot to impersonatethe monkey tries t break the circle bylunging against the joined hands while theboys in the ring try to throw him on his backby swinging their arms when he jumps onthem This is to represent the monkeyjumping against the ropes of the trap andbeing thrown back therefromShould the monkey succeed in breakingthe circle and escaping the person releasinghis hold must in turn Become monkey whilethe escaped boy takes a place in the ringShould he fail to break the circle he is allowed t rest being supposed to lie exhausted The song then continues and tellshow he tries to jump over the rope thatholds him only to lind himself still fastenedTo illustrate this the boys each throw oneleg over th circle of hands thus straddlingtheir arms and while in this attitude jumpup and down three times This is then repeated with the other leg If any boy fallsor breaks his hold he is regarded as havingset the monkey free and must take his placein the trap The game begins atUW witheach monkeyT choosing out in this and similar games the method most commonly usedis that of choosing hands one hand holdinga 11 Mile the other empty The one holding the pebble after all have chosen is iteither leader oigoat Each player beforechoosing recites the following
