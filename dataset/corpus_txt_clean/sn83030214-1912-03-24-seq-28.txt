asked in genuine wonder 1 nt women always know Do you suppose any woman in theworld was ever taken unawares Bui h Ned our friendship hasbeen so good and so pleasant What a pity to spoil it Dont youfeel how splendid it is that a young man and a young woman shouldbe able to talk face t face as we have talked1 donl kniw Gladys Vou see 1 can talk face lo face withwith the station master I cant imagine how that official came intothe matter but in he trotted ami set us both laughing Thai doesnot satisfy me in the least I want my arms round you and yourhead on my breast and oh Gladys I want She had sprung from her chair as she saw signs that I proposed todemonstrate some of my wants Youve spoiled everything Nedshe said Its all SO beautiful and natural until this kind of thingcomes in Il is such a pity Why cant you control yourselfI didnt invent it I pleaded Its loveWell perhaps if both love it may be different I have neverfelt itHut you must you with your beauty with your soul oh tladys you were made for love Vou must love lue must wait till it comesHut why cant you love me Gladys Is it my appearance orwhatShe did unbend a little She put forward a handsuch a graciousStooping attitude it was and she pressed back my head Then shelooked into my upturned face with a very wistful smileNo it isnt that she said at last Youre nt a conceited boyby natureand so  can safely tell you it is not that Its deeter My characterShe nodded severelyWhat can I do to mend it1 Do sit down and talk it over Noreally I wont if youll only sit downShe looked at me with a wondering distrust which was much moreto my mind than her wholehearted confidence How primitive andbestial it looks when you put it down in black and white and perhaps after all it is only a feeling peculiar to myself Anyhow she satdownNow tell me whats amiss with meIm in love with somebody else said sheIt was my turn to jump out of my chairIts nobody in particular she explained laughing at the expression of my face only an ideal Ive never met the kind of manI meanTell me about him What does he look likeOh he rrnighl look very much like youHow dear of you to say that Well what is it that he docs thatI donl lo Just say the word teetotal vegetarian aeronauttheosophist superman Ill have a try at it Gladys if vou will onlyjve me an idea What WOUld jilease youCHIC laughed at the elasticity of my character Well in the firstplace I dont think my ideal would speak like that said sheHe would be a harder sterner man not so ready to adapt himself toa silly girls whim But above all he musl be a man who could dowho could act who could look Death in the face and have no far ofhim a man of great deeds and Strange experiences It is never aman that I should love but always the glories he had won forthey would be reflected upon me Think of Richard BurtonWhen I read his wifes life of him I could so understand her loveAnd Lady Stanley Did you ever read the wonderful Last chapterof that book These are the sort of men that a woman couldworship with all her soul and yet be the greater not the less onaccount of her love honored by all the world as the inspirer ofnoble deedsShe looked so beautiful in her enthusiasm that I nearly broughtdown the whole level of the interview I gripped myself hard andwent on with the argumentWe cant all be Stanleys and Burtons said I besides wedont get the chance at least I never had the chance If I did Ishould try to take it Hut chances are all around you It is the mark of the kind of manI mean that he makes his own chances Vou cant hold him backIve never met him and yet  seem to know him so well There archeroisms all round us waiting t be done Its for men to do themand for women to reserve their love as a reward for such men Lookat thai young Frenchman who went up last week in a balloon Itwas blowing a gale of wind but because he was announced t go heinsisted on starting The wind blew him fifteen hundred miles iitwentyfour hours and he fell in the middle of Russia Thai

month could you gone down and helped those people in spite of the choke daiI did You never said soThere was nothing worth bucking aboutI didnt know She looked at me with more interestwas brave of youI had to If you want to write good copy you must bethe things are  What a prosaic motive It seems to take all the romance out iFancy George stirring up the Dragon in order to get copy out f hitBut still whatever your motive I am glad that you went down thmine She gave me her hand but with so much sweetness dignity that 1 could only sloop and kiss it I dare say I aia foolish woman with a young girls fancies And yet it iwith me so entirely part of my very self that I cannot help aupon it If I marry I do want to marry a famous manWhy should you not I cried It is women like y umen u Youve braced me up Give me a chance and i   Itake it Besides as you say men ought to nitikc their own ch iand not wait until they are given Look at Clive just a Clhe conquered India By George Ill do something in theyetShe laughed at my sudden Irish effervescence Why notsaid You have everything a man could have youth hstrength education energy I was sorry you spoke And now iglad so glad if it wakens these
