for it was ni so conveniently situated We stopped al one or both of theselighthouses in advance of nearly every landing to getthe latest bulletins as to what the warships were doingWith this information it was ordinarily a comparativelysimple matter to dodge them They had to be takeninto our cal illations of course but they never causeme much anxiety It was oiilv when we were making

loading lier with anus and having her towed to within easydistance of Cuba luit she could carry only seventytons while the cargo that had been ordered for thistrip weighed nearly one hundred tons and was valueda eighty thousand dollars It was therefore decided tocarry our coal supply on the schooner and put the armson t lu ocean going tug Alexander Jones which had beenengaged to do the towing With her bunkers practically empty ami taking her coal from the schoonerevery lay or two the Jones could carry the cargo withmit any troubleThe two carloads of arms and ammunition wereshipped from New York
