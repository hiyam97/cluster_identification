compliments toProfessor Challenger and would take it as a personal favor if he would dothctn the honor to come to their next meeting The answer was unprintable Yu dont sayWell a Bowdlerized version of it would run  Professor Challenger presents his compliments to the president of the Zoological Institute andwould take it as a personal favor if he would g to the devilGood LordYes I expect thats what old Wadlcy said I remember his wail atthe meeting which began In fifty years experience of scientific intercourse  It quite broke the old man upAnything mon aboul ChallengerWell Im a bacteriologist you know I live in a ninehundreddiameter microscope I can hardly claim to take serious notice of anything that I can see with my naked eye Im a frontiersman from theextrnne edge of the Knowablc and I feel quite out of place when I leavemy study and come into touch with all you great rough hulkingcreatures Im too detached to talk scandal and yet at scientific conversaziones I have heard something of Challenger for he is one of thosemen whom nobody can ignore Hes as clever as they make cm a fullcharged battery of force and vitality but a quarrelsome ill conditionedfaddist and unscrupulous at that He had gone the length of fakingsome photograph over the South American business You say he is a faddist What is his particular fadHe has a thousand Hut the latest is something about Weissmann andevolution He had a fearful row about it in Yienna I believeCant you tell me the pointNot at the moment but a translation of the proceedings exists Wehave it filed at the office Would you care to comeIts just what I want I have t interview the fellow and I need somelead up to him Its really awfully good of you to give me a lift Illgo with you now if it is not too lateTJTALF an hour later I was seated in the newspaper office with a hugetome in front of me which had been opened at the Article Weissmann versus Darwin with the subheading Spirited Protest at ViennaLively Proceedings My scientific education having been somewhatneglected I was unable to follow the whole argument but it was evidentthat the English professor had handled his subject in very aggressivefashion and had thoroughly annoyed his Continental colleagues Protests Uproar and General appeal to the chairman were three ofthe first brackets which caught my eye Most of the matter might havebeen written in Chinese for any definite meaning that it conveyed tomy brain I wish you could translate it into English for me I said pathetically tomy helpmateWell it is a translationThen Ill try my luck with the originalIt h certainly rather deep for a layman If I could only gel a single good meaty sentence which seemed to convey some sort of definite human idea it would serve my turn Ah yesthis one will do I seem in a vague way almost to understand it Ill copyit out This shall be my link with the terrible professorNothing else I can doWell yes I propose to write to him If I could frame the letter hereand use your address it would give atmosphereWell have the fellow round here making a row and breaking thefurnitureNo no youll see the letternothing contentious I assure youWell thats my chair and desk Youll find paper there Id like to Jcensor it before it oesIt took some doing but I flatter myself that it wasnt such a bad jobwhen it was finished I read it aloud to the critical bacteriologist withsome pride in my handiworkI IBAS PbOFBSSOI Ciiuim__ As a humlilistulnt of Nature I have always takenthe most profound interest in your speculations as to the diffrences between Darwin an 1iissminn
